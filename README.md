This repo is the home for all of my red team and offensive security practice. Everything in here is created inside my own lab using Kali Linux, vulnerable machines, and hands on attack techniques.  
The goal of this lab is to build real experience in web exploitation, privilege escalation, Active Directory attacks, buffer overflows, and general red team operations.

Each folder in this repo is its own dedicated project with its own notes, payloads, screenshots, and reports.
