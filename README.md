This repo is a collection of my offensive security projects, labs, and practical walkthroughs. Everything here is built in my home lab using Kali Linux, vulnerable machines, and hands on tools. The goal of this repo is to show my progress in penetration testing, web exploitation, privilege escalation, and overall red team skills.
